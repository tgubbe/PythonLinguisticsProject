# PythonLinguisticsProject
This repository contains the Python project I completed for my Linguistics class. The purpose of the project was to analyze and compare the readability of the works
of Charles Dickens and Nathaniel Hawthorne.

The Python code is saved in the repository as a .ipnyb file. For more details on the project, I have included a PDF document describing my project and the analysis.
